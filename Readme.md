# Books' Crown

<b>This application is made by me, Atul Sharma, in 2018 using JAVA Programming. </b>

Make sure you have the appropriate version of Java and MySQL according to the year(2018) mentioned if error comes otherwise it supports all versions of Java and MySQL.

You have to install mysql without password and with all other default settings.

Just simply copy the text of the file "MySQL file for Book's Crown.txt" and paste it in your mysql and hit enter i.e. run these all commands in mysql respectively.

After all these you can simply install the executable(.exe) file and run the programme.

ENJOY :)
