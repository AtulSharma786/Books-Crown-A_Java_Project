This application is made by me Atul Sharma in 2018.

Make sure you have the appropriate version of Java and MySQL according to the year(2018) mentioned if error comes otherwise it supports all versions of Java and MySQL.

You have to install mysql without password and with all other default settings.

Just simply copy the text of the file "MySQL file for Book's Crown.txt" and paste it in your mysql and hit enter(means run these all).

After all these then you can simply install the executable(.exe) file and run the programme.

ENJOY :)
